# Extra note of Expanded_Top_Ten_Big_Data_Security_and_Privacy_Challenges.pdf
## Objective
I will discusss some related terms about big data security and its privacy challenges as extra notes.
### Content of related terms
1. grandular access control
2. grandular data (<- grandular access control)
3. data provenance

### Prequisite
To fully understand the core concepts of these terms and what can they be applied in our daily life, it is important to know the 

3 requirements of data security.

To know 3 requirements of data security.

Visit my notes. (I will publish it later.)

#### 2. grandular data
It is detailed data, or the lowest level that data can be in a target set. A grandular data can NOT be divided into smaller piece. 

Exactly to say, it refers to the size that data fields are divided into, in short how detail-oriented a single field is.

Such as your name. 

Your name consists of 1 first name and 1 last name.

And the first name can NOT be divided into smaller pieces. Thus, it is considered a grandular data. And so is the last name.

However, your real name can be divided into 2 fields. Thus, it is considered more grandular data.

#### 1. grandular access control
It is a concept in computer science that refers to the practice of granting differing levels of access to a particular resource to particular users. 

This techniqure is very important since the access can determine what users can do. 

Then differing levels of access means differiating this operation can be done by what kind of users.
