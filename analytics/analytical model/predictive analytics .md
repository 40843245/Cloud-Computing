# predictive analytics
## Intro
It is a technique to generate predictives about future unknowns using mathmatical modeling tools.

## Type

Here, we just list 5 major predicitves models.

### Regression
Here, we just discuss the basic type of regression -- Linear Regression.
#### Linear Regression
In Linear Regression, it can be expressed as

    y=f(x)=m*x+b 
    where
    x is the given data (can be considered as input).
    y is the predictive data (can be considered as output).
    m is the slope of the expression.
    b is the intercept of x.

### Text mining

According to the reference, Goulding says.

    “Text mining is part of predictive analytics in the sense that analytics is 

    all about finding the information I previously knew nothing about,” Goulding says. 

### Optimal Estimation 
It is a technique that is used to make predictions based on <b>observed</b> factors.

###  Clustering Models
In the clustering model, the data will be grouped into many bins first. Then one analyze them.

It includes:
  
    K-Means
    Hierarchical Clustering
    TwoStep
    Density-Based Scan Clustering
    Gaussian Clustering Model
    Kohonen 
    
### Neural Networks
In a typical neural network, it consists of artifical neurons (also called units) arranged in different layers.

## Importance and application
Why is predictive analytics very important?

I think it is imporant because 
  
    1)We can use it to predict the unknowns for future, helping us to make a critical decisions for us.
   
Additionally, according to the references, Goulding says that

    “Analytics is getting exciting in every industry 
    because we’re [more] equipped than ever to use the data in the back room that has been gathering dus
    to make better business decisions,” Goulding says.
