## Category
1. BigTable : 
2. Cassandra : one of the most known engines for NoSQL. 

## Details of them

### BigTable
#### Feature
The system is 
      
      distributed,
      high efficient and
      proprietary 
      
to manage structured data.

Since it  organizes tables as different  groups of columns 
with variable dimensions and consisting  in a sparse, distributed, persistent, multidimensionalsorted  map.

### Cassandra
#### Feature

It supplies <b>high performance </b> at <b>massive scale</b> and <b>high availability</b>

since it uses a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed architecture 

that is much more elegant, easy to set  up and maintain and has no single point-of-failure.

That is, when a node dies, other nodes can connect each other.

In P2P model, you can think that each user is a node where its degree is at least 2.
