# XSS (Cross-site Scripting) attack
## Intro
XSS attack refers to an attack that injects a code in html file.

Recall that 
1. to develope a website, we have to use html, php, and JS etc.
2. The .html file can execute JS code either in the attribute of a html tag or in a "<script>" tag.

  Consider the following example.
  
              
   <!DOCTYPE html5>
  
   <html>
      
  </html>
