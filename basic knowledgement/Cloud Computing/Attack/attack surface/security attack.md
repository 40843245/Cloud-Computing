# Security attack
## Recall
Recall that there are different cloud layer in CC.
  
    1) SaaS
    2) PaaS
    3) IaaS
    
## Objective
In this artcile, I will simply discuss the security attack in each cloud layer.

Let's get started.

## Security attack on SaaS cloud layer

1) Dos attack and its extension.

For more details, see my notes.

2) Authecation attack.
    
        The core concepts of this attack involves the approaches to target the mechanism which is used by the user to authencate the system.
        
        The approaches includes 
        
        2.1) All ways to guess the user's account and password of administrator such as brute-force etc. 
        2.2) Social engineering. Use social engineering to lower the users worriness, easily provides the account and password to the attacker.

        Once attacker get the user's account and password. Attacker can grant the administrator privilege in system, performing some scaring operation in terminal 
        (such as installing malware packages etc).
        
        For example, in Linux system, to enter the root account, just type these command in terminal.
        
        <b>sudo -i</b>
        
        Then the system will require your password.
        
        What happen if your password is stolen? 
        
        you should know.
