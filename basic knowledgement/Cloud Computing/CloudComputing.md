# Cloud Computing (CC)

## Feature
    
A CC service should meet these requirements.
    
    on-demand self-service 
   
    broad newtwork access 
    
    resource pooling 
    
    rapid elasicity
    
    measured service
 
### on-demand self-service 
When you need it, don't need people to finish it.

Imagine that you are in a buffe restuarant, you can put the food in your palette by yourself.

The concept of On-demand self-service is applied to buffe.

### broad network access
It refers the capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanism that promote use by hetergeneous thin or thick client platforms.

### Resource pooling 
The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically

assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.

### Rapid elasticity
A CC provider must provide a rapid and elasticity which means consumers can determine to use the service at anytime.

### Measured service 
A CC can measure how data a consumer consumes.

For example, in Taiwan, the telephone billing is according to how many messages you sent and how long do you talk with your phone.

The data can be measured in telephone service, thus, we can say that it meets a requirement -- a mesaured service.


It is via from the figure.

## Service Model

    SaaS
    PaaS
    IaaS
    
### SaaS

The capability provided to the consumer is to use the  providerâ€™s applications running on a cloud infrastructure.

### PaaS

The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using 

programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

### IaaS

The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to 

deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications.
